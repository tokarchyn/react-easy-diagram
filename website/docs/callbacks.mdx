title: Callbacks
---

All callbacks receive two arguments: `info` with the information about event occured, and `rootStore` which gives you access to entire diagram state.

To start using any callbacks define them in settings:
```jsx
const YourDiagram = () => (
  <Diagram initState={...} settings={{
    callbacks: {
      onNodesAddResult: (info, store) => {
        if (info.addedNodes.length > 0) {
          console.log('Added nodes:',info.addedNodes.map((n) => n.export()));
        }
      }
    }
  }} />
);
```

:::tip
[Here](/examples/callbacks) you can find example of callbacks usage.
:::

## onNodesAddResult
Is called whenever [addNodes](api/classes/NodesStore#addnodes), [addNode](api/classes/NodesStore#addnode) or [import](api/classes/NodesStore#import) are called regardless of the fact if any nodes were actually added.

Information type: [OnNodesAddResult](api/interfaces/OnNodesAddResult)

## onNodesRemoveResult
Is called whenever [removeNode](api/classes/NodesStore#removenode), or [removeNodes](api/classes/NodesStore#removenodes) are called regardless of the fact if any nodes were actually removed.

Information type: [OnNodesRemoveResult](api/interfaces/OnNodesRemoveResult)

## onNodePositionChanged

Information type: [OnNodePositionChanged](api/interfaces/OnNodePositionChanged)

## onDragStarted

Information type: [OnDragStarted](api/interfaces/OnDragStarted)

## onDrag

Information type: [OnDrag](api/interfaces/OnDrag)

## onDragEnded

Information type: [OnDragEnded](api/interfaces/OnNodesAddResult)

## onImportedStateRendered
Is called whenever imported nodes and links are rendered.
Callback does not provide any additional information.

## onLinkValidation
Is called whenever the diagram is trying to validate if it is possible to connect source and target ports. This callback should return `boolean` where `true` means connecting is possible.

See example [here](/examples/calculator).

Information type: [OnLinkValidation](api/interfaces/OnLinkValidation)

## onLinksAddResult
Is called whenever [addLinks](api/classes/LinksStore#addlinks), [addLink](api/classes/LinksStore#addlink) or [import](api/classes/LinksStore#import) are called regardless of the fact if any links were actually added.

Information type: [OnLinksAddResult](api/interfaces/OnLinksAddResult)

## onLinksRemoveResult
Is called whenever [removeLink](api/classes/LinksStore#removelink), or [removeLinks](api/classes/LinksStore#removelinks) are called regardless of the fact if any links were actually removed.

Information type: [OnLinksRemoveResult](api/interfaces/OnLinksRemoveResult)

## onLinkingStarted

Information type: [OnLinkingStarted](api/interfaces/OnLinkingStarted)

## onLinkingEnded

Information type: [OnLinkingEnded](api/interfaces/OnLinkingEnded)
